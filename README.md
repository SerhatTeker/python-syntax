Python syntax highlighting script for Vim
=========================================

Enhanced version of the original Python syntax highlighting script.
Based on `python.vim` from Vim 7.4 distribution by Neil Schemenauer (nas at python dot ca).

Features
--------

Changes from the original `python.vim` are:

* Highlight standard operators (~,!,^,&,|,*,/,%,+,- ...)
* Highlight pseudo operators (-=,//=,*=,&=,%=,+=,!= ...)

How to install
--------------

The easiest installation method is to place `syntax/python.vim` script into your `~/.vim/syntax/` directory.
You can also use `Pathogen` or `Vundle` plugin managers in which case you can install the whole `kh3phr3n/python-syntax`
repository into the corresponding plugins directory.

Informations
------------

This plugin is strongly inspired by:

* [python-syntax](https://github.com/hdima/python-syntax)
* [pretty-vim-python](https://github.com/pfdevilliers/Pretty-Vim-Python)
